## Utility Based AI for FPS Enemy AI 

In this project I will be using an AI technique called Utility base AI for the enemy AI in an FPS game.

<b>6/2/20</b> - Starting Point
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>I began by planning out what kind of buckets would be required for the AI as well as what values the AI would monitor/used 
          for utility calculations. I cloned a copy of an old FPS shooter I created which the AI would use as its enviroment. After that I            started to making the base classes for both the buckets and the actions that the AI would use.
  </li>
</ul>

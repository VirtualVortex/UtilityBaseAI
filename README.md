## Utility Based AI for FPS Enemy AI 

In this project I will be using an AI technique called Utility base AI for the enemy AI in an FPS game.

<B>6/2/20</B> - Starting Point
          I began by planning out what kind of buckets would be required for the AI as well as what values the AI would monitor/used for             utility calculations. I cloned a copy of an old FPS shooter I created for the enviroment of the game. After that I started to             making the base classes for both the buckets and the actions that the AI would use.

## About Me

My name is Max and I'm a Second year student at Falmout University currenlty studying Game Development: Programming. 

I've worked on a game last year called 'Lost Kingdom of Turia' which was a 2D plaformer where you could befriend spirits and use their powers to progress through through out the level. I also attended 2020's Global Game Jam a the University where me and the team created a fun game about reparing the Oppurunity Mars rover.

Both of these projects have help me improve as both a programmer and a team member

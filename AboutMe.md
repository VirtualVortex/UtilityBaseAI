## About Me 

<img class = "one" src="PictureOfMe.jpg" width="15%" height="15%" />

My name is Max and I'm a Second year student at Falmouth University currenlty studying Game Development: Programming. Currently using Unity and C# to make games but trying to learn Unreal Engine 4 and C++/Blueprints. I also have an interest in the other area of game development such as design, art and music compasition. I also make silver and copper jewellery as a hobby.

I'm currently working on a 2D platform where anxiety is a part of the game mechanics and you have make your way up a light house to over come your worries. I've worked on a game last year called 'Lost Kingdom of Turia' which was a 2D plaformer where you could befriend spirits and use their powers to progress through the levels. I also attended 2020's Global Game Jam a the University where me and the team created a short yet fun game about reparing the opportunity Mars rover.

All of these projects have helped me improve both with my programming and team working skills. In addition, I have been learning and improving on how to work in an agile envrioment for the past 2 years.
